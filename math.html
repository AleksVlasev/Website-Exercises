    <p> Here's a litle excerpt. It's often difficult to compare people of different sizes in sports.
        Taller people tend to be much heavier than shorter ones. They also tend to be stronger in the absolute sense
        but not as strong in the relative sense. Most sports disciplines have some distinctions based on size - most often mass.
        In my research I used simple models of the human body to study the effects of human size on certain characteristics like mass,
        strength and speed, and certain processes like jumping, lifting weights and dancing. There are two main types of scaling - isometric and allometric.
        Imagine two people - one who is shorter and smaller than the other. If human beings scaled isometrically, you would expect
        that on average the taller person would be a geometric copy of the smaller one, just bigger.
        However that's not how human and animals scale in general. This deviation from geometric similarity is called allometry.
        That is, the taller person is stretch and expanded in certain ways that reduce the geometric similarity.

        The effect is really stark if we compare an animal like a mouse with a tiger or a tiger with an elephant.
        Their features are vastly different. The situation is also quite severe - a mouse scaled up to the size of a tiger
        (isometrically) would collapse and probably not be able to breathe. Certainly its legs would become useless.
        However if we assume that people scale isometrically we obtain a useful model because the variation among humans is not too large.
        Of course there are exceptions like comparing the shortest with the tallest people. However if the variation is a foot or two,
        the model becomes useful and has some predictive power. In a later version we'll explore allometric scaling of people but for now we'll stick with isometry.
